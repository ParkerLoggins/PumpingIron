    <img src="ParkerLoggins_About.jpg" width="30%">
    <h4>Innovative Biostatistician at a US News Top 100 & Carnegie® R1 recognized School of Medicine with 3+ years of experience in various healthcare sectors (public health, clinical, research). My passion for addressing health disparities brought me to the University of Nevada, Reno where I am working on my bachelor’s degree. <br><br> I get excited about opportunities where I’m able to work with highly creative professionals to develop & deliver high-quality, large-scale revolutionary solutions in the healthcare space. <br><br> Along with my passion for healthcare, I’ve gradually realized my passion in the financial industry throughout my life. I began my investing journey 4 years ago, consistently prioritizing my portfolio potential annually & conducting strategic research into diverse & outperforming investments featured in the S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones and Russell 2000 indices. Outside of my traditional elective coursework, I've dedicated countless hours exploring financial & mathematical topics in my spare time including Equity Research, Asset Management and Quantitative Modeling.</h4>
